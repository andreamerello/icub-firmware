PMC software
============

This repo contains some demo software for the PMC board. It's not the application firmware; it's used to test and develop the *piezo motor driver* and the associated encoder drivers.

You might want to give a look at [the piezo driver](./Drivers/piezo) and/or to the [encoder drivers](./Drivers/encoder)
